This repository contains the code and data required to reproduce the analyses and figures contained in "Combinatorial G x G x E CRISPR screen discovers SLC25A39 in mitochondrial glutathione transport linking iron homeostasis to OXPHOS".

To keep the size of the repository reasonable, the high-quality PDF images produced by the pipeline have been omitted, but may be reproduced by running the relevant scripts under `src/`. The raw and filtered/processed data are given, but some plots may require other datasets that will need to be created by running the scripts under `src/`.
